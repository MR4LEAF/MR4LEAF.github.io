Chen Cheng, born in 1991, holds a PhD and serves as an Associate Researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He obtained his PhD in Instrument Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. His doctoral dissertation was nominated for the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award by the China Instrument and Control Society. He previously worked at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and received support from projects such as the "Super Postdoctoral Fellow" in Shanghai, the General Program of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, and the Special Fund for Postdoctoral Researchers in Residence.

Chen has been deeply involved in high-precision measurement and instrumentation research for three-dimensional surface morphology for a long time. He has conducted in-depth research on the fundamental theories, core algorithms, and instrument design of optical measurement technologies, including optical interference and scattering measurement, confocal measurement, and dispersive confocal measurement. He has led projects such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China and key project topics of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Chen has published 21 representative papers in international journals in the field and has over 10 domestic invention patents disclosed.

# Create content & metadata
------
# For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

# I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
# ) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

# How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
# Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
